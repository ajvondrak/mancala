[Mancala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala) is a family of traditional
board games with widely varying rules. In general, gameplay begins by placing a
certain number of _seeds_ in each _pit_ on the board. Players take turns
_sowing_ by selecting one of their pits, collecting all its seeds, and placing
one seed into each of the following pits in sequence (illustrated above -
[source](https://www.behance.net/gallery/28963121/Mancala)). The object is to
collect the most seeds in your _store_ - a large pit that you may sow to, but
not from.

This repository contains an implementation of the particular set of Mancala
rules that I played by as a kid. I'm using it as a toy project to try out
[Go](https://golang.org/).
